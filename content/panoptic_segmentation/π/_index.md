2023, Self-Published Artist book, Handmade, Edition of 25.
Riso print, 143 x 81 x 12 mm.

The flip book compiles screenshots, from the artist’s personal image reel; it makes them public in a gesture that resists the fleeting nature of sensitive content when within an internet-based media environment. Having witnessed ubiquitous censorship throughout life, Zhou has developed an ability to intuit when content is prone to be taken down. These screenshots are fragments, information records that may otherwise be blocked and disappear.

In the book, the traditional Japanese binding stitching was altered to have open edges; this makes it possible to read π from different directions. Vertically, a continuous flow of screenshots proves hard to decode; horizontally, a passage of time sheds light on a historically informed understanding of events. Akin to the periodic nature of the mathematical constant π, the book suggests a kind of circularity; it fosters a continuous cycle that aims to convey unity and fraternity among us.
