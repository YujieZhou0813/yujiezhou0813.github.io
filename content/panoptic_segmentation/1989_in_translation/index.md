### **<span style="color: #850000;">1989 in Translation</span>**



2022, Single-channel video, color, sound, 4:28 minutes  

*1989 in Translation* marks my first step up a Ladder. Here I walk you through my coming across a chapter in history that my education have be misplaced xxxxx (which I do not dare to openly discuss). In the video, the text displayed on the wall traces an excerpt from the first book I read about the protest after I began using VPN (Virtual Private Network) to bypass the Great Firewall. The audio component of the work featured the sound of Radio Calisthenics, a daily mandatory radio gymnastic exercise for every Chinese student from primary to high school. I performed this exercise in front of Google Lens, while Google Translate generated illegible text blocks in response to my body movements.
